    # 144933 (15261 human)   ECO:0000250     X SKIP "By similarity": "We use the ECO code ECO:0000250 for manually curated information which has been propagated from a related experimentally characterized protein. The accession number of the experimental source is provided (except for some historic UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot annotations, see Why don't all UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot annotations have evidence? )."
    # 114979 (15102 human)   [NULL]          X SKIP In human, this only happens for N-GlcNAc and O-GalNAc. In other species, it mostly seems to be N-glycosylation and C-palmitoylation, and T-GalNAc, but also N6-(pyridoxal phosphate)lysine (with no PMID and untraceable). Sites with this ECO don't have PMIDs (very bad), nor are they "By similarity", "Probable" or "Potential" (which would be good): they could not be automatically evidence-annotated by looking for "By similarity, Probable and Potential qualifiers that marked information that was not experimental as well as the Cited for section of literature citations which indicates the type of information retrieved from a given reference": "The annotations which are missing evidence were created before we started to manually curate information with evidence attribution in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot. The manual attribution of evidence to these existing annotations was not possible due to the huge amount of existing data. Therefore we wrote a program to automatically add the evidence based on how provenance information was previously curated in Swiss-Prot including the By similarity, Probable and Potential qualifiers that marked information that was not experimental as well as the Cited for section of literature citations which indicates the type of information retrieved from a given reference. This allowed the attribution of evidence to a substantial fraction of annotations in Swiss-Prot but not to all annotations. The remaining annotations without evidence must be updated and retrofitted manually, which is an ongoing process. (https://www.uniprot.org/help/evidence_in_swissprot)"
    # 71864  (37909 human)   ECO:0007744     KEEP Experimental large-scale mass spec or PDB structure evidence.

We use the ECO code ECO:0000255 in manual assertions and ECO:0000256 (and its descendant code ECO:0000259 ) in automatic assertions, respectively, for information which has been generated by the UniProtKB automatic annotation system. The database name and identifier of the sequence model rule that has been used by the system are provided. The ECO code ECO:0000255 is also used for information which has been generated by various sequence analysis programs that are used during the manual curation process and which has been verified by a curator."

The PubMed identifier of the publication(s) which is the original source of the information is provided (for publications that are not in PubMed we indicate instead the corresponding UniProtKB reference number(s))."
    # 2458     (609 human)   ECO:0000305     KEEP Curator-added. Seems to be based on very reasonable experimental evidence (e.g. S191 in ENAM_HUMAN from PMID 25789606, which explicitly states S191 is phosphorylated). "Curator inference evidence. We use the ECO code ECO:0000305 for manually curated information which has been inferred by a curator based on his/her scientific knowledge or on the scientific content of an article.

    # 48        (18 human)   ECO:0000312     KEEP From another database. Using this myself for dbPTM etc. Always coincides with ECO:0000269 (small-scale experimental evidence) in UniProt, except for one case, https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/K7N5M5/entry#ptm_processing, where the other database is PDB (perfect).
