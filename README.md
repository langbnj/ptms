Preprint: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.06.25.661537v1

## Contents

**analyses**: R scripts used to perform statistical analyses and produce figures.

**include**: Utility functions.

**mysql_tables**: MySQL table structures (CREATE statements).

**pipeline**: Scripts used to extract and analyse data from data tables (SQL).

**scripts**: Additional utility scripts.

**update**: Scripts used to fill data tables (SQL).

For "pipeline" and "update", first run "download.py" (or "download.pl") to download datasets, followed by "run.py" (or "run.pl").

## Note

Please don't hesitate to contact me/us for questions and assistance with these scripts (<benjamin.lang@cantab.net>). They have grown historically as these analyses grew far more complex than originally envisioned, though hopefully they are commented well enough to follow along and use them. Thank you!
