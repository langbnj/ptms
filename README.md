Preprint: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.06.25.661537v1

## Contents

**analyses**: R scripts used to perform statistical analyses and produce figures.

**include**: Utility functions.

**mysql_tables**: MySQL table structures (CREATE statements).

**pipeline**: Scripts used to extract and analyse data from SQL tables.

**scripts**: Additional utility scripts.

**update**: Scripts used to fill SQL tables. "run.pl" is the main script in each folder.

For "pipeline" and "update", first run "download.py" to download datasets, followed by "run.py".

## Note

Please don't hesitate to contact me/us for questions and assistance with these scripts. They have grown historically as these analyses grew far more complex than originally envisioned, though hopefully they are commented well enough to follow and use them. Thank you!
